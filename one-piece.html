	<img class="featured-images" src="assets/images/luffy.jpg">
	<p>
		Monkey D. Luffy (モンキー・D・ルフィ, Monkī Dī Rufi) is the primary protagonist of the One Piece series. At age seven, he admires and tries to join the pirates of the "Red Haired" Shanks. Ridiculed and rejected, he inadvertently eats their treasure, the Paramecia-type Gum-Gum Fruit (ゴムゴムの実, Gomu Gomu no Mi), which gives his body the properties of rubber. His reckless efforts ultimately lead him into grave peril causing Shanks to lose an arm while rescuing him. After this, Luffy gives up on joining Shanks, resolving instead to start a crew of his own and become King of the Pirates. Displeased by Shanks spoiling his grandson, Garp takes Luffy to be raised by Curly Dadan and her mountain bandits, who he strong-arms into taking him in. During Luffy's time there, he becomes a sworn brother with Garp's other ward Ace, and local runaway noble Sabo.[ch. 582–589] Ten years later, and still wearing Shanks' treasured head covering, Luffy forms and captains his own pirate crew called The Straw Hat Pirates and sets sail for the Grand Line, quickly gaining infamy as "Straw Hat" Luffy (麦わらのルフィ, Mugiwara no Rufi). Eventually, after his strength proves insufficient to save Ace from execution, he spends two years on a secluded island, before entering in the New World, learning the use of the three colors of Haki as well as the fourth Gear from Silvers Rayleigh, before heading to the New World. Luffy is voiced by Mayumi Tanaka in the anime series. In the 4Kids Entertainment English adaptation, he is voiced by Erica Schroeder.

Eventually, he comes into conflict with Helmeppo. To prevent the harm of innocent civilians, Zoro allows himself to be incarcerated temporarily, while Helmeppo plots to have him killed. Zoro is saved from execution by Luffy in exchange for becoming his first crewman. At that point, Zoro makes it clear that he would turn on his captain if he ever stepped between him and his dream.

	<p>
		During his early childhood, Usopp (ウソップ, Usoppu) is abandoned by his father, Yasopp, who leaves to join the Red-Haired Pirates. Then, as Bachina, his mother falls ill, Usopp starts telling tall tales, expressing his hope that his father will return and take them out to sea. Even after his mother dies, Usopp does not blame his father for leaving. Despite his cowardly disposition, he strives to become a great pirate himself. Usopp is recognizable for his long nose, a reference to the fact that he tends to lie a lot. He is a gifted inventor, painter, and sculptor. In combat, he relies primarily on slingshots to fire various kinds of ammunition with great precision in coordination with a set of lies and different other weapons giving him a unique fighting style named "The Usopp Arsenal". To help the Straw Hats rescue Nico Robin, he achieves notoriety under his alter-ego "Sniper King, the King of Snipers" (狙撃の王様そげキング, Sogeki no Ō-sama Sogekingu), a hero sniper wearing a golden mask and cape.

	<h2>Sanji</h2>
	<img class="featured-images" src="assets/images/sanji.jpg">
	<p>
		Born as a prince of Germa Kingdom, Vinsmoke Sanji (ヴィンスモーク・サンジ, Vinsumōku Sanji) is routinely ridiculed by his genetically enhanced siblings and is locked away by his father Judge for being a disgrace. With help from his sister Reiju, he escapes and flees the kingdom after it enters the East Blue and his father permits it. While serving as an apprentice cook on a passenger ship, nine-year-old Sanji stands up to a boarding party of pirates led by the infamous "Red Foot" Zeff. During the encounter, Sanji is swept into the sea by a massive wave. Zeff jumps in after him because of their common dream of finding the All Blue (オールブルー, Ōru Burū), a legendary sea, containing every kind of fish in the world. While castaways together, the pirate saves Sanji's life yet again by giving him all of their food. After their eventual rescue, Sanji stays with Zeff for several years and helps him build a floating restaurant, the Baratie (バラティエ). Zeff in turn makes him a first-rate cook and teaches him his kick-based fighting style. Mirroring Zeff, Sanji will never refuse a starving person a meal, and when fighting only uses his legs, to protect the hands he needs to cook. He also develops an unusual weakness for women, and makes it a principle never to harm one, even if it means his death. Eventually, he becomes infamous under the name of "Black Leg" Sanji (黒脚のサンジ, Kuro Ashi no Sanji), and, while training for a period of two years in Emporio Ivankov's Kamabakka Queendom (カマバッカ王国, Kamabakka Ōkoku), develops the Sky Walk (空中歩行, Sukai Wōku), a variant of the Six Powers (六式, Rokushiki) technique Moonwalk (月歩, Geppo), which allows him to essentially run through air. Sanji receives his own Raid Suit from his family that grants him the ability to turn invisible. Sanji's standard appearance is to be wearing a well fitting black suit, with a skinny black tie. His hair always covers one of his eyes and he is generally smoking a cigarette. In the Japanese anime television series, he is voiced by Hiroaki Hirata. In the 4Kids English adaptation, he is voiced by David Moo. In the Funimation English adaptation, his voice is supplied by Eric Vale.
